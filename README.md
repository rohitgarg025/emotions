# Emotions
## Datasets
* **Emotion-Recognition**
  1. [DEAP](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/): Includes 32 subjects, each watchine 1-min long excerpts of music-videos, rated by users in terms of arousal/valence/like-dislike/dominanace/famaliarity, and frontal face recording of 22/32 subejcts.
  2. [Enterface'06](http://www.enterface.net/results/): Enterface'06 Project 07: EEG(64 Channels) + fNIRS + face video, Includes 16 subjects, where emotions were elicited through selected subset of IAPS dataset.
  3. [Imagined Emotion](http://headit.ucsd.edu/studies/3316f70e-35ff-11e3-a2a9-0050563f2612): 31 subjects, subjects listen to voice recordings that suggest an emotional feeling and ask subjects to imagine an emotional scenario or to recall an experience in which they have felt that emotion before.
  4. [NeuroMarketing](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2T1rQUvyyWcSGVVaHZBZzRtTms): 25 subjects, 14 electrodes, Like/Dislike on commercial e-commerce products over 14 categories with 3 images each. Article for the dataset: Analysis of EEG signals and its application to neuromarketing. [[Article]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-017-4580-6)
  5. [SEED](http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~seed/seed.html): 15 subjects were shown video clips eliciting positive/negative/neutral emotion and EEG was recorded over 62 channels.
  6. [SEED-IV](http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~seed/seed-iv.html): 15 subjects were shown video clips ellicity happy/sad/neutral/fear emotions and EEG was recorded over 62 channels (with eye-tracking) for 3 sessions per subject (24 trials per session).
  7. [SEED-VIG](http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~seed/seed-vig.html): Vigilance labels with EEG data in a simulated driving task. 18 electrodes and eye-tracking included.
  8. [HCI-Tagging](https://mahnob-db.eu/hci-tagging/): Subjetcs were shown video clips (fragments of movies) and they were asked to annotate the emotional state on the scale of valence and arousal. During the whole experiment, audio, video, gaze data and physiological data were recorded simultaneously with accurate synchronisation between sensors.
  9. [Regulation of Arousal](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/regulation-arousal-online-neurofeedback-improves-human-performance-demanding-sensory): 18 subjects going through an online flight simulator study with three different audio-feedback silence, sham and BCI.
